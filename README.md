Hi, Hope you are all doing good. 
I have done this test using React JS and Redux and Material UI. This task covers the solution for the technical test. 
Where a user can upload a cat Image at /upload Route and can view the uploaded cat images at / route.
He can also other stuff like fav/unfavorite the cat images by using the buttons below of the cat image.
And more like he can vote the cats based on his choice and each cat image is tagged with score card.
### How to run the application:
1) Go the the Root directory
2) run the command yarn
3) run the command yarn start

Tech Aspects:

### developer view points 
Axios package used to make the API calls to the Cat Catalogue.

No Tests are provided for this exercise, but I am happy to do cover those during the tech call.

UI is mediocre level since the styling those can be done based on our preference during the call probably .

### Points I care about on this exercise:
1) Focused more on the solution and integrating the api's.
2) A workable solution and a happy journey

### Improvements:
1) A lot many ways this can be improved, but being a first stage and the time i have . I focused much on the solution.

2) regarding the score API,  i did not get the concept correctly, since the app does not provide the login for customers and always use the one ```sub_id`` and which returns 0 or 1 for a given customer. Because a single customer can vote or de-vote.

correct me if I'm wrong.

3) UI: this place is definitely  a place can be improved. But given the time I did not focus much on it, happy to talk on this on the call..

### Requests:

I request several of my own github repo's has this kind of tests, please go through anyone of them they have the full TDD covered.

Example repo: https://github.com/karri-sek/superMarketBasket

Another repo covers mainly on the backend: https://github.com/karri-sek/LandTechTest

Another one on using vue JS : https://github.com/karri-sek/translator-ui

I hope these repos will provide some knowledge on my tech abilities .

Thanks,
Sekhar.

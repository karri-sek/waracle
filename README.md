React js test

Hi, Hope you are all doing good. 
I have done this test using React JS and Redux and Material UI. This task covers the solution for the technical test. 
Where a user can upload a cat Image at /upload Route and can view the uploaded cat images at / route.
He can also other stuff like fav/unfavorite the cat images by using the buttons below of the cat image.
And more like he can vote the cats based on his choice and each cat image is tagged with score card.

Tech Aspects:

Axios package used to make the API calls to the Cat Catalogue.

No Tests are provided for this exercise, but I am happy to do cover those during the tech call.

UI is medicore level since the styling those can be done based on our preference during the call probably .


Requests:

I request several of my own github repo's has this kind of tests, I request please go through anyone of them they have the full TDD covered.

Example repo: https://github.com/karri-sek/superMarketBasket
Another repo covers mainly on the backend: https://github.com/karri-sek/LandTechTest

Another one on using vue JS : https://github.com/karri-sek/translator-ui

I hope these repos will provide some knowledge on my tech abilities .
Thanks,
Sekhar.
